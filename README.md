# Description
Ever wanted to read a Korean Web Novel, but you don't want to translate and nagivate on the site known as Booktoki?
Well, now you can simply find the booktoki link, Copy + Paste it and you are now scraping data from the website and automatically translating it to English!!!

Note: I have not figured out a way to bypass the Booktoki CAPTCHA, Cloudfare was easy, but Booktoki's is a letter/number recognition system. If the CAPTCHA appears it will break your script, so you must scroll up in the terminal and find the last chapter it was scraping and restart at that chapter and do the CAPTCHA yourself

# Dependencies
Must have a Webdriver installed, such as chromedriver.exe
SeleniumBase and it's dependencies
Googletrans and it's dependencies
